# Titanic EDA

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The objective is to uncover insights about survival rates based on different passenger features.

## 📊 Features

- Load and inspect Titanic dataset
- Clean missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
- Visualize survival rates by:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age distribution
- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🗂 Files Included

- `titanic_eda.py` – Main Python script for the project
- `Screenshot 2025-07-19 150712.png` – Sample output visualization
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 📁 Dataset

This project uses the `train.csv` dataset from the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition on Kaggle.

Make sure `train.csv` is in the same directory as the script.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the files.
2. Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
